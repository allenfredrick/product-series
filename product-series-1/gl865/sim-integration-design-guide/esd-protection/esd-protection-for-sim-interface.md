# ESD protection for SIM interface

### ESD protection for SIM interface

It’s possible to use dedicated ESD protection chips with integrated EMI filters designed for the SIM like ECLAMP2465T or TPD3F303. If these components are used it’s possible to avoid mounting the 33pF capacitors indicated in Figure 2-1, only the 1uF capacitor must remain, we suggest leaving the solder pads to have the possibility to mount the 33pF capacitors if necessary.
