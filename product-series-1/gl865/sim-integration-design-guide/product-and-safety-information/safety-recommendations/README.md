### Safety Recommendations

Make sure the use of this product is allowed in your country and the environment required. The use of this product may be dangerous and has to be avoided in areas where:

* it can interfere with other electronic devices, particularly in environments such as hospitals, airports, aircraft, etc.
* there is a risk of explosion such as gasoline stations, oil refineries, etc. It is the responsibility of the user to enforce the country regulation and the specific environment regulation.

Do not disassemble the product; any mark of tampering will compromise the warranty validity. We recommend following the instructions of the hardware user guides for the correct wiring of the product. The product has to be supplied with a stabilized voltage source and the wiring has to be conformed to the security and fire prevention regulations. The product has to be handled with care, avoiding any contact with the pins because electrostatic discharges may damage the product itself. Same cautions have to be taken for the SIM, checking carefully the instruction for its use. Do not insert or remove the SIM when the product is in power-saving mode.

The system integrator is responsible for the functioning of the final product. Therefore, the external components of the module, as well as any project or installation issue, have to be handled with care. Any interference may cause the risk of disturbing the GSM network or external devices or having an impact on the security system. Should there be any doubt, please refer to the technical documentation and the regulations in force. Every module has to be equipped with a proper antenna with specific characteristics. The antenna has to be installed carefully to avoid any interference with other electronic devices and has to guarantee a minimum distance from the body (20 cm). In case this requirement cannot be satisfied, the system integrator has to assess the final product against the SAR regulation.

The equipment is intended to be installed in a restricted area location.

The equipment must be supplied by an external specific limited power source in compliance with the standard EN 62368-1:2014.
