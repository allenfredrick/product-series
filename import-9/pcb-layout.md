# PCB Layout

### PCB Layout

In this section general rules are given on how to place and connect the components on the PCB to obtain better results on the EMI side.

The placement of the 33 pF filtering capacitors is very important to maximize their effectiveness; the capacitors should be placed as closest as possible to the SIM pins and intercept the tracks that go to the module. Figure 3-1 and Figure 3-2 show wrong PCB designs:
